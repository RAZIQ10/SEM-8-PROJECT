# SEM-8-PROJECT
Thyroid Detection and Classification Using DNN Based on Hybrid Meta-Heuristic and LSTM Technique

🔍 Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying thyroid diseases from ultrasound images using deep learning. It uses a combination of DNN, LSTM, and a hybrid optimization algorithm (GWO + PSO) to improve accuracy. A simple web interface is developed using Streamlit for users to upload images and get real-time results.
